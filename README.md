In the root directory run:

`npm install`

The application accepts two arguments and returns the total amount of money in dollars. Both are optional but the first argument if you pass it has to be a crypto coin name, and the second argument is the quantity. If you omit both arguments, the app defaults to BitCoin with the quantity 1. If you omit just the second argument the quantity is 1.
